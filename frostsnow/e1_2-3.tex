\section*{Exercise 1.2-3}

The smellest value of $n$ such that an algorithm whose running time is $100n^2$ runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is $2^n$ on the same machine may be found by solving the following for the smallest value of $n$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
	100n^2 & < & 2^n \\
	100 & < & \frac{2^n}{n^2}
\end{eqnarray*}
Since, like the previous exercise, I do not know of a way to solve this equation for $n$ symbolically, using a program (see \texttt{1\_2-3.c}) yields the result:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	n & = & 15
\end{eqnarray*}
