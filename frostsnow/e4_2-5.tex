In order to determine the running time of V. Pan's algorithm, place it in terms of Strassen's Algorithm by solving for $x$ in $n^x = k$. To denote the three matrices and their multiplication count, use subscripts and solve each of the following equations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	n_1 = 68 & & k_1 = 132,464 \\
	n_2 = 70 & & k_2 = 143,640 \\
	n_3 = 72 & & k_3 = 155,424
\end{eqnarray*}
Solving the previous equation with these values gives:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	x_1 = \log_{68}{132,464} & \approx & 2.795 \\
	x_2 = \log_{70}{143,640} & \approx & 2.795 \\
	x_3 = \log_{72}{155,424} & \approx & 2.795
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus all methods have the same asymptotic running time. Compared to Strassen's Algorithm, which runs in $n^{2.81}$ time, V. Pan's algorithm runs asymptotically faster.
