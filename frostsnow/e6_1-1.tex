A primitive, but effective, way to solve this is to just make a table with appropriate values and then eyeball a solution:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c}
	$h$ & min & max \\ \hline
	$0$ & $1$ & $1$ \\
	$1$ & $2$ & $3$ \\
	$2$ & $4$ & $7$ \\
	$3$ & $8$ & $15$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
From this, the forumlas $\min = 2^h$ and $\max = 2^{h+1} - 1$ can be inferred.
